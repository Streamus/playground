# playground

Goal:

- The goal of this repository is to have a functional prototype of one section of a greater Streamus' web application. The prototype will be demo'ed to users to gauge interest.

- End result will be a representation of reddit.com/r/trap which emphasizes a more polished UI and more streamlined UX when interacting with SoundCloud/YouTube posts.

- Built with VueJS + Vuex (learning!)
